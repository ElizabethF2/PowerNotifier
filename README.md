A Windows utility that will play sounds to notify the user when their laptop is unplugged or plugged in. Make two wav files called unplugged.wav and plugged_in.wav and place them in the same path as the compiled exe before running it.

This readme is a stub. Full documentation and a license will be added in the future. See the current comments and code for info regarding setup and usage.
